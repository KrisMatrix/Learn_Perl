<p>PDL::ImageND - useful image processing in N dimensions</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>These routines act on PDLs as N-dimensional objects, not as broadcasted sets of 0-D or 1-D objects. The file is sort of a catch-all for broadly functional routines, most of which could legitimately be filed elsewhere (and probably will, one day).</p>

<p>ImageND is not a part of the PDL core (v2.4) and hence must be explicitly loaded.</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code> use PDL::ImageND;

 $y = $x-&gt;convolveND($kernel,{bound=&gt;&#39;periodic&#39;});
 $y = $x-&gt;rebin(50,30,10);
 </code></pre>

<h1 id="FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</h1>

<h2 id="convolve">convolve</h2>

<pre><code>  Signature: (a(m); b(n); indx adims(p); indx bdims(q); [o]c(m))</code></pre>

<p>N-dimensional convolution (Deprecated; use convolveND)</p>

<pre><code>  $new = convolve $x, $kernel</code></pre>

<p>Convolve an array with a kernel, both of which are N-dimensional. This routine does direct convolution (by copying) but uses quasi-periodic boundary conditions: each dim &quot;wraps around&quot; to the next higher row in the next dim.</p>

<p>This routine is kept for backwards compatibility with earlier scripts; for most purposes you want <a href="./ImageND.html#convolveND">convolveND</a> instead: it runs faster and handles a variety of boundary conditions.</p>

<p>convolve does not process bad values. It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is set for any of the input ndarrays.</p>

<h2 id="ninterpol">ninterpol()</h2>

<p>N-dimensional interpolation routine</p>

<pre><code> Signature: ninterpol(point(),data(n),[o]value())</code></pre>

<pre><code>      $value = ninterpol($point, $data);</code></pre>

<p><code>ninterpol</code> uses <code>interpol</code> to find a linearly interpolated value in N dimensions, assuming the data is spread on a uniform grid. To use an arbitrary grid distribution, need to find the grid-space point from the indexing scheme, then call <code>ninterpol</code> -- this is far from trivial (and ill-defined in general).</p>

<p>See also <a href="./Primitive.html#interpND">interpND</a>, which includes boundary conditions and allows you to switch the method of interpolation, but which runs somewhat slower.</p>

<h2 id="rebin">rebin</h2>

<pre><code>  Signature: (a(m); [o]b(n); int ns =&gt; n)</code></pre>

<p>N-dimensional rebinning algorithm</p>

<pre><code>  $new = rebin $x, $dim1, $dim2,..;.
  $new = rebin $x, $template;
  $new = rebin $x, $template, {Norm =&gt; 1};</code></pre>

<p>Rebin an N-dimensional array to newly specified dimensions. Specifying `Norm&#39; keeps the sum constant, otherwise the intensities are kept constant. If more template dimensions are given than for the input pdl, these dimensions are created; if less, the final dimensions are maintained as they were.</p>

<p>So if <code>$x</code> is a 10 x 10 pdl, then <code>rebin($x,15)</code> is a 15 x 10 pdl, while <code>rebin($x,15,16,17)</code> is a 15 x 16 x 17 pdl (where the values along the final dimension are all identical).</p>

<p>Expansion is performed by sampling; reduction is performed by averaging. If you want different behavior, use <a href="./Transform.html#map">PDL::Transform::map</a> instead. PDL::Transform::map runs slower but is more flexible.</p>

<p>rebin does not process bad values. It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is set for any of the input ndarrays.</p>

<h2 id="circ_mean_p">circ_mean_p</h2>

<p>Calculates the circular mean of an n-dim image and returns the projection. Optionally takes the center to be used.</p>

<pre><code>   $cmean=circ_mean_p($im);
   $cmean=circ_mean_p($im,{Center =&gt; [10,10]});</code></pre>

<h2 id="circ_mean">circ_mean</h2>

<p>Smooths an image by applying circular mean. Optionally takes the center to be used.</p>

<pre><code>   circ_mean($im);
   circ_mean($im,{Center =&gt; [10,10]});</code></pre>

<h2 id="kernctr">kernctr</h2>

<p>`centre&#39; a kernel (auxiliary routine to fftconvolve)</p>

<pre><code>        $kernel = kernctr($image,$smallk);
        fftconvolve($image,$kernel);</code></pre>

<p>kernctr centres a small kernel to emulate the behaviour of the direct convolution routines.</p>

<h2 id="convolveND">convolveND</h2>

<pre><code>  Signature: (k0(); SV *k; SV *aa; SV *a)</code></pre>

<p>Speed-optimized convolution with selectable boundary conditions</p>

<pre><code>  $new = convolveND($x, $kernel, [ {options} ]);</code></pre>

<p>Conolve an array with a kernel, both of which are N-dimensional.</p>

<p>If the kernel has fewer dimensions than the array, then the extra array dimensions are broadcasted over. There are options that control the boundary conditions and method used.</p>

<p>The kernel&#39;s origin is taken to be at the kernel&#39;s center. If your kernel has a dimension of even order then the origin&#39;s coordinates get rounded up to the next higher pixel (e.g. (1,2) for a 3x4 kernel). This mimics the behavior of the earlier <a href="#convolve">&quot;convolve&quot;</a> and <a href="./FFT.html#fftconvolve">fftconvolve</a> routines, so convolveND is a drop-in replacement for them.</p>

<p>The kernel may be any size compared to the image, in any dimension.</p>

<p>The kernel and the array are not quite interchangeable (as in mathematical convolution): the code is inplace-aware only for the array itself, and the only allowed boundary condition on the kernel is truncation.</p>

<p>convolveND is inplace-aware: say <code>convolveND(inplace $x ,$k)</code> to modify a variable in-place. You don&#39;t reduce the working memory that way -- only the final memory.</p>

<p>OPTIONS</p>

<p>Options are parsed by PDL::Options, so unique abbreviations are accepted.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="boundary-default:-truncate">boundary (default: &#39;truncate&#39;)</dt>
<dd>

<p>The boundary condition on the array, which affects any pixel closer to the edge than the half-width of the kernel.</p>

<p>The boundary conditions are the same as those accepted by <a href="./Slices.html#range">range</a>, because this option is passed directly into <a href="./Slices.html#range">range</a>. Useful options are &#39;truncate&#39; (the default), &#39;extend&#39;, and &#39;periodic&#39;. You can select different boundary conditions for different axes -- see <a href="./Slices.html#range">range</a> for more detail.</p>

<p>The (default) truncate option marks all the near-boundary pixels as BAD if you have bad values compiled into your PDL and the array&#39;s badflag is set.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="method-default:-auto">method (default: &#39;auto&#39;)</dt>
<dd>

<p>The method to use for the convolution. Acceptable alternatives are &#39;direct&#39;, &#39;fft&#39;, or &#39;auto&#39;. The direct method is an explicit copy-and-multiply operation; the fft method takes the Fourier transform of the input and output kernels. The two methods give the same answer to within double-precision numerical roundoff. The fft method is much faster for large kernels; the direct method is faster for tiny kernels. The tradeoff occurs when the array has about 400x more pixels than the kernel.</p>

<p>The default method is &#39;auto&#39;, which chooses direct or fft convolution based on the size of the input arrays.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>NOTES</p>

<p>At the moment there&#39;s no way to broadcast over kernels. That could/should be fixed.</p>

<p>The broadcasting over input is cheesy and should probably be fixed: currently the kernel just gets dummy dimensions added to it to match the input dims. That does the right thing tersely but probably runs slower than a dedicated broadcastloop.</p>

<p>The direct copying code uses PP primarily for the generic typing: it includes its own broadcastloops.</p>

<p>convolveND does not process bad values. It will set the bad-value flag of all output ndarrays if the flag is set for any of the input ndarrays.</p>
