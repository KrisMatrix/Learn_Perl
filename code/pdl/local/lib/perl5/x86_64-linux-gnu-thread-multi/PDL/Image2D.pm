=head2 conv2d

=for sig

  Signature: (a(m,n); kern(p,q); [o]b(m,n); int opt)

=for ref

2D convolution of an array with a kernel (smoothing)

For large kernels, using a FFT routine,
such as L<fftconvolve()|PDL::FFT/fftconvolve()> in C<PDL::FFT>,
will be quicker.

=for usage

 $new = conv2d $old, $kernel, {OPTIONS}

=for example

 $smoothed = conv2d $image, ones(3,3), {Boundary => Reflect}

=for options

 Boundary - controls what values are assumed for the image when kernel
            crosses its edge:
 	    => Default   - periodic boundary conditions
                           (i.e. wrap around axis)
 	    => Reflect   - reflect at boundary
 	    => Truncate  - truncate at boundary
 	    => Replicate - repeat boundary pixel values



=for bad

Unlike the FFT routines, conv2d is able to process bad values.

=head2 med2d

=for sig

  Signature: (a(m,n); kern(p,q); [o]b(m,n); double [t]tmp(pq); int opt)

=for ref

2D median-convolution of an array with a kernel (smoothing)

Note: only points in the kernel E<gt>0 are included in the median, other
points are weighted by the kernel value (medianing lots of zeroes
is rather pointless)

=for usage

 $new = med2d $old, $kernel, {OPTIONS}

=for example

 $smoothed = med2d $image, ones(3,3), {Boundary => Reflect}

=for options

 Boundary - controls what values are assumed for the image when kernel
            crosses its edge:
 	    => Default   - periodic boundary conditions (i.e. wrap around axis)
 	    => Reflect   - reflect at boundary
 	    => Truncate  - truncate at boundary
 	    => Replicate - repeat boundary pixel values



=for bad

Bad values are ignored in the calculation. If all elements within the
kernel are bad, the output is set bad.

=for sig

  Signature: (a(m,n); [o]b(m,n); int __p_size; int __q_size; int opt)


=for ref

2D median-convolution of an array in a pxq window (smoothing)

Note: this routine does the median over all points in a rectangular
      window and is not quite as flexible as C<med2d> in this regard
      but slightly faster instead

=for usage

=head2 box2d

=for sig

  Signature: (a(n,m); [o] b(n,m); int wx; int wy; int edgezero)


=for ref

fast 2D boxcar average

=for example

  $smoothim = $im->box2d($wx,$wy,$edgezero=1);

The edgezero argument controls if edge is set to zero (edgezero=1)
or just keeps the original (unfiltered) values.

C<box2d> should be updated to support similar edge options
as C<conv2d> and C<med2d> etc.

Boxcar averaging is a pretty crude way of filtering. For serious stuff
better filters are around (e.g., use L</conv2d> with the appropriate
kernel). On the other hand it is fast and computational cost grows only
approximately linearly with window size.

patch bad pixels out of 2D images using a mask

=for usage

 $patched = patch2d $data, $bad;

C<$bad> is a 2D mask array where 1=bad pixel 0=good pixel.
Pixels are replaced by the average of their non-bad neighbours;
if all neighbours are bad, the original data value is
copied across.

=for sig

  Signature: (a(m,n); [o]b(m,n))

=for ref

patch bad pixels out of 2D images containing bad values

=for usage

 $patched = patchbad2d $data;

Pixels are replaced by the average of their non-bad neighbours;
if all neighbours are bad, the output is set bad.
If the input ndarray contains I<no> bad values, then a straight copy
is performed (see L</patch2d>).


=for bad

patchbad2d handles bad values. The output ndarray I<may> contain
bad values, depending on the pattern of bad values in the input ndarray.

=for ref

Refine a list of object positions in 2D image by centroiding in a box

C<$box> is the full-width of the box, i.e. the window
is C<+/- $box/2>.



=for bad

Bad pixels are excluded from the centroid calculation. If all elements are
bad (or the pixel sum is 0 - but why would you be centroiding
something with negatives in...) then the output values are set bad.

=for ref

Return bounding box of given mask in an C<indx> ndarray, so it can broadcast.
Use other operations (such as L<PDL::Bad/isgood>, or
L<PDL::Primitive/eqvec> with a colour vector) to create a mask suitable
for your application.

=head2 polyfill

=for ref

fill the area of the given polygon with the given colour.

This function works inplace, i.e. modifies C<im>.

=for usage

  polyfill($im,$ps,$colour,[\%options]);

The default method of determining which points lie inside of the polygon used
is not as strict as the method used in L</pnpoly>. Often, it includes vertices
and edge points. Set the C<Method> option to change this behaviour.

=for option

Method   -  Set the method used to determine which points lie in the polygon.
            => Default - internal PDL algorithm
            => pnpoly  - use the L</pnpoly> algorithm

=for example

  # Make a convex 3x3 square of 1s in an image using the pnpoly algorithm

'points in a polygon' selection from a 2-D ndarray

=for usage

  $mask = $img->pnpoly($ps);

  # Old style, do not use
  $mask = pnpoly($x, $y, $px, $py);

For a closed polygon determined by the sequence of points in {$px,$py}
the output of pnpoly is a mask corresponding to whether or not each
coordinate (x,y) in the set of test points, {$x,$y}, is in the interior
of the polygon.  This is the 'points in a polygon' algorithm from
L<http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html>
and vectorized for PDL by Karl Glazebrook.

=for example

  # define a 3-sided polygon (a triangle)
  $ps = pdl([3, 3], [20, 20], [34, 3]);

  # $tri is 0 everywhere except for points in polygon interior
  $tri = $img->pnpoly($ps);

  With the second form, the x and y coordinates must also be specified.
  B< I<THIS IS MAINTAINED FOR BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ONLY> >.

  $px = pdl( 3, 20, 34 );
  $py = pdl( 3, 20,  3 );

  # $tri is 0 everywhere except for points in polygon interior

rotate an image by given C<angle>

=for example

  # rotate by 10.5 degrees with antialiasing, set missing values to 7
  $rot = $im->rot2d(10.5,7,1);

This function rotates an image through an C<angle> between -90 and + 90
degrees. Uses/doesn't use antialiasing depending on the C<aa> flag.
Pixels outside the rotated image are set to C<bg>.

Code modified from pnmrotate (Copyright Jef Poskanzer) with an algorithm based
on "A Fast Algorithm for General  Raster  Rotation"  by  Alan Paeth,
Graphics Interface '86, pp. 77-81.

Use the C<rotnewsz> function to find out about the dimension of the
newly created image

  ($newcols,$newrows) = rotnewsz $oldn, $oldm, $angle;

L<PDL::Transform> offers a more general interface to
distortions, including rotation, with various types of sampling; but
rot2d is faster.

=for ref

Find the best-fit 2D polynomial to describe
a coordinate transformation.

=for usage

  ( $px, $py ) = fitwarp2d( $x, $y, $u, $v, $nf, { options } )

Given a set of points in the output plane (C<$u,$v>), find
the best-fit (using singular-value decomposition) 2D polynomial
to describe the mapping back to the image plane (C<$x,$y>).
The order of the fit is controlled by the C<$nf> parameter
(the maximum power of the polynomial is C<$nf - 1>), and you
can restrict the terms to fit using the C<FIT> option.

C<$px> and C<$py> are C<np> by C<np> element ndarrays which describe
a polynomial mapping (of order C<np-1>)
from the I<output> C<(u,v)> image to the I<input> C<(x,y)> image:

  x = sum(j=0,np-1) sum(i=0,np-1) px(i,j) * u^i * v^j
  y = sum(j=0,np-1) sum(i=0,np-1) py(i,j) * u^i * v^j

The transformation is returned for the reverse direction (ie
output to input image) since that is what is required by the
L<warp2d()|/warp2d> routine.  The L<applywarp2d()|/applywarp2d>
routine can be used to convert a set of C<$u,$v> points given
C<$px> and C<$py>.

C<FIT> allows you to restrict which terms of the polynomial to fit:
only those terms for which the FIT ndarray evaluates to true will be
evaluated.  If a 2D ndarray is sent in, then it is
used for the x and y polynomials; otherwise
C<< $fit->slice(":,:,(0)") >> will be used for C<$px> and
C<< $fit->slice(":,:,(1)") >> will be used for C<$py>.

=begin comment

=item THRESH

Remove all singular values whose value is less than C<THRESH>
times the largest singular value.

=end comment

The number of points must be at least equal to the number of
terms to fit (C<$nf*$nf> points for the default value of C<FIT>).

=begin comment

Some explanation of the following three subroutines (_svd, _mkbasis,
and fitwarp2d): See Wolberg 1990 (full ref elsewhere in this
documentation), Chapter 3.6 "Polynomial Transformations".  The idea is
that, given a set of control points in the input and output images
denoted by coordinates (x,y) and (u,v), we want to create a polynomial
transformation that relates u to linear combinations of powers of x
and y, and another that relates v to powers of x and y.

The transformations used here and by Wolberg differ slightly, but the
basic idea is something like this.  For each u and each v, define a
transform:

u = (sum over j) (sum over i) a_{ij} x**i * y**j , (eqn 1)
v = (sum over j) (sum over i) b_{ij} x**i * y**j . (eqn 2)

We can write this in matrix notation.  Given that there are M control
points, U is a column vector with M rows.  A and B are vectors containing
the N coefficients (related to the degree of the polynomial fit).  W
is an MxN matrix of the basis row-vectors (the x**i y**j).

The matrix equations we are trying to solve are
U = W A , (eqn 3)
V = W B . (eqn 4)

We need to find the A and B column vectors, those are the coefficients
of the polynomial terms in W.  W is not square, so it has no inverse.
But is has a pseudo-inverse W^+ that is NxM.  We are going to use that
pseudo-inverse to isolate A and B, like so:

W^+ U = W^+ W A = A (eqn 5)
W^+ V = W^+ W B = B (eqn 6)

We are going to get W^+ by performing a singular value decomposition
of W (to use some of the variable names below):

W = $svd_u x SIGMA x $svd_v->transpose (eqn 7)
W^+ = $svd_v x SIGMA^+ x $svd_u->transpose . (eqn 8)

Here SIGMA is a square diagonal matrix that contains the singular
values of W that are in the variable $svd_w.  SIGMA^+ is the
pseudo-inverse of SIGMA, which is calculated by replacing the non-zero
singular values with their reciprocals, and then taking the transpose
of the matrix (which is a no-op since the matrix is square and
diagonal).

So the code below does this:

_mkbasis computes the matrix W, given control coordinates u and v and
the maximum degree of the polynomial (and the terms to use).

_svd takes the svd of W, computes the pseudo-inverse of W, and then
multiplies that with the U vector (there called $y). The output of
_svd is the A or B vector in eqns 5 & 6 above. Rarely is the matrix
multiplication explicit, unfortunately, so I have added EXPLANATIONs
below.

=for sig

  Signature: (img(m,n); double px(np,np); double py(np,np); [o] warp(m,n); { options })

=for ref

Warp a 2D image given a polynomial describing the I<reverse> mapping.

=for usage

  $out = warp2d( $img, $px, $py, { options } );

Apply the polynomial transformation encoded in the C<$px> and
C<$py> ndarrays to warp the input image C<$img> into the output
image C<$out>.

The format for the polynomial transformation is described in
the documentation for the L<fitwarp2d()|/fitwarp2d> routine.

At each point C<x,y>, the closest 16 pixel values are combined
with an interpolation kernel to calculate the value at C<u,v>.
The interpolation is therefore done in the image, rather than
Fourier, domain.
By default, a C<tanh> kernel is used, but this can be changed
using the C<KERNEL> option discussed below
(the choice of kernel depends on the frequency content of the input image).

The routine is based on the C<warping> command from
the Eclipse data-reduction package - see http://www.eso.org/eclipse/ - and
for further details on image resampling see
Wolberg, G., "Digital Image Warping", 1990, IEEE Computer
Society Press ISBN 0-8186-8944-7).

Currently the output image is the same size as the input one,
which means data will be lost if the transformation reduces
the pixel scale.  This will (hopefully) be changed soon.

=for example

  $img = rvals(byte,501,501);
  imag $img, { JUSTIFY => 1 };
  #
  # use a not-particularly-obvious transformation:
  #   x = -10 + 0.5 * $u - 0.1 * $v
  #   y = -20 + $v - 0.002 * $u * $v
  #
  $px  = pdl( [ -10, 0.5 ], [ -0.1, 0 ] );
  $py  = pdl( [ -20, 0 ], [ 1, 0.002 ] );
  $wrp = warp2d( $img, $px, $py );
  #
  # see the warped image
  imag $warp, { JUSTIFY => 1 };

The options are:

=for options

  KERNEL - default value is tanh
  NOVAL  - default value is 0

C<KERNEL> is used to specify which interpolation kernel to use
(to see what these kernels look like, use the
L<warp2d_kernel()|/warp2d_kernel> routine).
The options are:

=over 4

=item tanh

Hyperbolic tangent: the approximation of an ideal box filter by the
product of symmetric tanh functions.

=item sinc

For a correctly sampled signal, the ideal filter in the fourier domain is a rectangle,
which produces a C<sinc> interpolation kernel in the spatial domain:

  sinc(x) = sin(pi * x) / (pi * x)

However, it is not ideal for the C<4x4> pixel region used here.

=item sinc2

This is the square of the sinc function.

=item lanczos

Although defined differently to the C<tanh> kernel, the result is very
similar in the spatial domain.  The Lanczos function is defined as

  L(x) = sinc(x) * sinc(x/2)  if abs(x) < 2
       = 0                       otherwise

=item hann

This kernel is derived from the following function:

  H(x) = a + (1-a) * cos(2*pi*x/(N-1))  if abs(x) < 0.5*(N-1)
       = 0                                 otherwise

with C<a = 0.5> and N currently equal to 2001.

=item hamming

This kernel uses the same C<H(x)> as the Hann filter, but with
C<a = 0.54>.

=back

C<NOVAL> gives the value used to indicate that a pixel in the
output image does not map onto one in the input image.
