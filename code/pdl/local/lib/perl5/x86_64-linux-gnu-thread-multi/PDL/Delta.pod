=head1 NAME

PDL::Delta - PDL changes between V1.0 and V2.0


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file is an attempt to list the major user-visible changes
between PDL versions 1.0 and 2.0.


=head1 Core Changes

=head2 ndarrays are not hashes any more:

    $x = zeroes 10,10;
    $$x{FOO} = "bar"

doesn't work. They are currently scalar references (to opaque
C structures in finer terms) because of speed as well as
syntactic issues. If you want to have a hash, use

    $x->hdr()

which returns a reference to an anonymous hash. Also,
subclassing works if you store an ndarray in the hash member ``PDL''.

There are also many core enhancements to support Dataflow and
Slicing tricks, but these do not introduce any incompatibilities.

=head2 Incompatible Changes vs 1.11
